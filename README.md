Bootstrap code for creating apps that use the CV Partner REST API.

## Getting started with the web app

Clone this repo and open a terminal / command line in its directory.

On Linux (Debian and possibly its derivatives):

    $ apt-get install nginx-light
    $ /usr/sbin/nginx -p nginx -c nginx.conf

On Windows:

1. Download and install Nginx.
2. Run the following commands:

	> ??

On OS X:

    > ??

Test that it works by opening <http://localhost:8888>. Verify that it
serves `webapp/index.html`. Then test the REST API by following the
instruction in the web page.
